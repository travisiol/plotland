/**
 * The claim surface the site expects from the deployed contract.
 *
 * `claimedBitmap` is the important one and the reason it is worth speccing
 * the contract around this page rather than the other way round: the map
 * needs to know the state of all 999 parcels at once, every time it draws.
 * 999 booleans pack into four 256-bit words, so the whole world is one
 * cheap view call instead of 999 ownerOf() lookups or an indexer.
 *
 * Bit n of word (n >> 8) is parcel n + 1 — parcel ids are 1-based to match
 * what the map labels, bits are 0-based.
 *
 * If the deployed contract names these differently, this file is the only
 * place to change.
