/*
 * A worked example of a world a few days old.
 *
 * Nothing here is real and nothing here is ever shown unless a visitor asks
 * for it: it sits behind an explicit "preview a live world" control so the
 * site can demonstrate what an active plot looks like without ever claiming
 * anybody has invested. The default state of the site remains the truth —
 * 999 plots open, none taken.
 *
 * Scale matters as much as honesty here. Three plots opened, a handful of
 * wallets in each, market caps in the low thousands: a fresh project that
 * showed sixty thousand owners would be advertising a lie about its size
 * even with the word "preview" over it.
